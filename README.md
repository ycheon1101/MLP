# MLP
I used simple MLP to reconstruct the image. 

I tried reconstruct the image with pure MLP. 

Target image:


<img src="images/cat.jpg">

Reconstructed image:


<img src="images/pure_mlp_test_img.jpg">


The reason why the reconstructed image looks strange is that positional encoding was not performed.
